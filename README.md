ProdTab is a lightweight, distraction‑free browser startpage that brings your daily tools together in a clean, dark, and minimal interface. It's designed for speed and privacy — everything runs completely in your browser and stores data locally using `localStorage`.

- Website: local static extension / startpage
- Tech: Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Storage: Browser `localStorage` (no servers, no data leaves your device)

## What's included

- Calendar — view the current date and pick a date to copy it in multiple formats
- Todo list — simple task list with persistent storage
- Bookmarks — quick links grid with icons and edit/delete controls
- Clipboard — 5 small slots for frequently-used text snippets with per-slot copy/paste
- Notepad — a simple persistent notes area
- Minimal dark theme — distraction-free, low-contrast design

## Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
2. Allow clipboard access when prompted for copy/paste features to work.
3. Use the UI to add bookmarks, copy dates, save clipboard snippets, add todos, and take notes.

> Tip: For full experience (extensions, pinned new-tab), load the folder in a browser extension environment or serve the folder from a local web server.

## Features & Usage

### Bookmarks

- Click the `+` next to "Bookmarks" to open a modal and add a bookmark (name + URL).

### Clipboard
